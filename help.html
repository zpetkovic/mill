			<p class="sectiontitle">Setup the game</p>
			<p class="text">Outlined below are the steps for setting up the game. We've aimed to make this setup process as easy and as quick as possible. The system will remember your selected topic between rounds to help you speed up gameplay.</p>
			<ol class="list">
				<li>Choose how you want to play. If you have 2 screens (includes projectors) conencted to your computer, follow the instructions under <a href="#section-setupmultiple">'Setup for multi-screen mode'</a> below. If you have one screen, just open <a href="controller.html" target="_blank">this</a> page and leave the 'enter code' box blank.</li>
				<li>Select the question set you want to play with by using the dropdown menu near the right.</li>
				<li>Choose the mode you want to play with: quiz mode (you have to input ask the audience votes and you must ask the 'friend' for their opinion) or revision mode (single-player, ask the audience and phones a friend results are generated for you)</li>
				<li>Click 'sync pages' to initialise and then click 'start game' to begin.</li>
				<li>Load the first question when you're ready by clicking 'load next question'.</li>

			<p class="sectiontitle">Setup for multi-screen mode</p>
			<p class="text">With this game, you have the option to play exactly like on TV - if you have 2 screens connected to your computer (includes projectors), you can use one to control the game and the other fo the contestant to use. The contestant won't be able to control the game and they won't be able to see the controller's button and options. This is more realistic and more like the TV show.</p>
			<ol class="list">
				<li>To set this up, you must configure your PC to 'extend screen' mode. In Windows, press the Windows key and P at the same time. Then select 'Extend'.</li>  
				<li>Open your web browser twice (preferably Google Chrome). Drag one onto the other screen and keep the other on the first screen. Maximise each one so that they fill their screen.</li>
				<li>On your screen, open <a href="controller.html" target="_blank">this</a> page.</li>
				<li>On the other screen (the contestant's one), open <a href="contestant.html" target="_blank">this</a> page.</li>
				<li>Click on each page in turn and press F11 to make it full screen.</li>
			</ol>

		<!--<section id="section-setupsingle">
			<p class="sectiontitle">Setup for single mode</p>
			<p class="text">If you don't have 2 screens or can't use extend mode, you can still play the game. Just open <a href="controller.html" target="_blank">this</a> page and type a * in the code input box. Then you can click sync pages and play as normal.</p>

				<li>If you've already had this question, click the orange 'generate new question' button to load another one.</li>

				<li>If the player wants to leave with the money they've got, click the red 'leave with the money' button (not available on the first question). A popup will appear displaying their score.</li>
